                    <h2 class="section-heading">What are These?</h2>
                    <p><br>Let’s start with proxies. A proxy’s main goal is to hide your real IP address. An IP address is a unique code used to identify you on the internet. Proxies spoof this by acting as a middleman between you and the websites you visit, so that the website thinks you’re visiting from the proxy server. They are typically programs you download, or they can be configured directly in the settings of applications. The main downsides to proxies is they don’t typically encrypt your traffic between your computer and the proxy server, they don’t tend to strip identifying information outside your IP address, and there are no additional privacy or security considerations built in. so when it comes to protecting your data from internet service providers, governments, or network attacks—proxies won’t really help you. What they will help with is simply masking your IP address.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Virtual Private Networks</h2>
                    <p><br>Let’s move to VPNs, VPN stands for Virtual Private Network; they’re going to hide your IP address and allow you to connect to servers around the world--like proxies; except there’s one major difference--your traffic is encrypted. So now, no one except the VPN company and you have the direct ability to view and see what you’re doing online. If your VPN is a good one, they themselves shouldn’t know what you’re doing either. Because VPNs are encrypted, any people who could potentially be between you and your final destination will have a difficult time figuring out what’s happening inside the VPN, meaning people like internet service providers won’t be able to snoop, collect, and sell your browsing data, which they DO do.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/home-bg.jpg">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Concluding</h2>
                    <p><br>Another benefit to VPN encryption is if you’re on public wifi, there’s a possibility the shady guy in the corner is using a free tool like Wireshark to view every connected device on the network to view its contents, including yours. He could just be watching, or he could be redirecting your connection to a JavaScript keylogger that logs all of your keystrokes to steal your passwords. This is called a man-in-the-middle attack. If you’re using a VPN, the creepy man can only see that you’re connected to a VPN, nothing else.<br><br>This is all great, but, there are downsides to VPNs. First, they use processing power to encrypt traffic, which may be tougher on older hardware. Second, they tend to cost more than proxies since they offer more functionality. Third, some sites like Google will give you a CAPTCHA request to ensure you’re a human, since your IP address is likely being used by a great number of people, this is extremely annoying.<br><br>Whether you go for a proxy or VPN, I will typically push you away from free services. It costs money to run them, so if you’re not paying with your cash, you’re most likely paying with your data.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
